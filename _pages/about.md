## Research Experience

### Efficient Exploration for R1-Searcher Follow-up
*   **Institution:** Renmin University of China
*   **Date:** March 2024 – Present
*   **Supervisor:** Prof. Xin Zhao ([AIBox RUC](http://aibox.ruc.edu.cn//))
*   **Collaborators:** Huatong Song, Jinhao Jiang
*   **Description:**
    *   Existing models trained via reinforcement learning to autonomously call external search engines show a tendency to over-rely on these engines.
    *   We are dedicated to developing models that can efficiently call external search engines while appropriately leveraging their internal knowledge to generate high-quality responses.
    *   Participated in cold-start phase exploration, reward function design, and model rewriting training.

### Exploration of Attacks and Defenses for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems
*   **Institution:** Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences
*   **Date:** December 2024 – February 2025
*   **Supervisor:** Prof. Fei Sun ([Personal Page](https://ofey.me/))
*   **Description:**
    *   We are exploring mechanisms to efficiently defend against database poisoning attacks.
    *   We are attempting to effectively utilize the internal knowledge of large language models in defense mechanisms.

### Ancient Chinese Poetry Q&A System based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
*   **Institution:** Beijing Institute of Technology
*   **Date:** October 2024 – November 2024
*   **Supervisor:** Prof. Yang Gao ([Faculty Page](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/bssds/78c31a2505434740a51076b614742941.htm))
*   **Description:**
    *   Responsible for implementing the Retrieval-Augmented Generation module, performing intent recognition for user queries, and dynamically invoking RAG:
        *   For fact-based queries, invoke RAG to improve the accuracy of model responses;
        *   For creative queries, invoke specific system prompts to maintain the creativity of model responses.

### Optimization of Approximate *Maximin Share* (MMS) for Indivisible Goods in Fair Division
*   **Institution:** Beijing Institute of Technology
*   **Date:** September 2024 – November 2024
*   **Supervisor:** Prof. Zhengyang Liu ([Personal Page](https://lozycs.github.io/))
*   **Description:**
    *   We are simultaneously studying two approximation models: multiplicative approximation and ordinal approximation:
        *   In multiplicative approximation, we aim to improve the lower bound of \(\alpha\) in \(\alpha\)-MMS by enhancing the bagging method;
        *   In ordinal approximation, we aim to explore whether the upper bound of \(d\) in \(1\)-out-of-\(d\) MMS can be further constrained when all agent valuation functions are identical.

### Interference Fringe Parameter Estimation Based on Huawei Cloud
*   **Institution:** Beijing Institute of Technology (Project Lead)
*   **Date:** December 2023 – November 2024
*   **Supervisor:** Prof. Mingfeng Lu ([Faculty Page](https://ice.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsfc/06dde97d106c421cb87c62605b9d76a3.htm))
*   **Description:**
    *   Utilized deep learning techniques to analyze Newton's rings interference phenomena, achieving regression from a single interference fringe image to obtain parameters such as the coordinates of Newton's ring center and the lens's radius of curvature.
    *   Improved the prediction accuracy of the two geometric parameters, ring center coordinates and radius of curvature, through measures such as task decoupling, feature sharing, independent optimization, and loss weight adjustment.
    *   Implemented parameter estimation using PyTorch and MindSpore successively, and deployed on ModelArts, achieving separation of data acquisition and data processing.
